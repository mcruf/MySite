<div style="text-align: justify"> 

I'm a biologist with a MSc degree in biological oceanography (FURG - Brazil) and a PhD degree in quantitative ecology (DTU - Denmark). During my research career I've largely focused on the development of spatio-temporal statistical models to support the spatial management and conservation of fisheries resources. I've dealt with data from both data-poor and data-rich contexts, whereby I also gathered expertise in frequentist and Bayesian approaches to address management issues. For a little more background about me, please click [**here**]({{<relref "home#context">}}).
