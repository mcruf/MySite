abstract: Under the IIFET 2018 Special Session "Tools for Stock Assessment, Economic Fishery Analysis, and Risk Assessment for Sustainable Management Strategies of Data Poor Stocks in Mixed, Small Scale and Indigenous Fisheries" a number of stakeholder presentations addressed the current status, challenges, needs and future perspectives for implementation of management and ecological / economic assessment of data poor fish stocks and fisheries in management advice. This covers methods, simulation models and management strategy evaluation (MSE) tools to conduct assessment and evaluate economic efficiency and risks in exploiting data poor stocks caught in mixed, small scale, and indigenous fisheries. Particular focus is on accessibility of models and their development to ensure widespread and open access availability, user-friendly model operation, and efficient widespread adoption and implementation of those by scientists, stakeholders, and managers. Additional focus is on the data requirements for those models. Finally, the aim of the session was to discuss the best possible way to link economic assessments, risk assessment and MSE with biological (ecological) assessment of stock status according to sustainable harvest levels in those data limited situations and systems to provide robust assessment and advice - and maybe even integrated ecological-economic advice?
